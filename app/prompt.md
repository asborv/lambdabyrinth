I am making a game in a course in advanced functional programming.
We use haskell, and are supposed to demonstrate competency in advanced FP concepts.
I will present the structure of my project to you, and all of its code. Then, I will ask you some questions.

Here is the program structure:

The files are split by module; I trust you can figure out which belong to which files.
Now, for my question:

As you can see, I am making an inventory system with items.
`Item` is an ADT which separates into different kinds of items.
The neat thing with this, is that the `Inventory` implementation is super-duper easy for the player!
However, this is at the expense of the type system. As you can see, I want to be able to calculate the defence points of any piece of armour. However, in the current implementation, it is legal to pass a weapon or potion to the defence calculator, that makes no sense! Continuing down the road of nonsense, it is also possible to equip a sword as a helmet, or health potion as boots. Again, completely nonsesical.

The crux of the problem is:
How do we build a type system such that the inventory can hold any kind of item (but no other types), still retainint type safety?
How can we make sure that the player's armour and weapon slots only hold intended kinds of items? We wish to be able to pick an item form the inventory, and put it on a player's head if it is a helmet; so the inventory *must* retain type information. We cannot rely on runtype checks. 

## Some proposed solutions

### Using GADTs

I've seen GADTs being used for similar problems; we are able to parameterize an ADT, and have concrete types for the different GADT constructors.
This is super handy for creating a type safe arithmetic/boolean expression interpreter.
I thought to include one here, with an implementation something like the following:

```haskell
data ItemKind = ArmourKind | WeaponKind -- | other types
data Item a where
    Armour :: Material -> ArmourPiece -> Item ArmourKind
    Weapon :: Material -> WeaponKind -> Item WeaponKind
```

This makes it able to give `Item ArmourType` as a type signature to the defence calculator, and the same for the attack calculation of weapons.
However, this complicates the inventory type, as I cannot make out which type I shall give to the inventory field of the `Player` constructor:

```haskell
data Player = Player
    { _name :: String
    , _pos :: Coordinate
    , _hand :: Maybe (Item WeaponType)
    , _helmet :: Maybe (Item ArmourType)
    , _cuirass :: Maybe (Item ArmourType)
    , _gloves :: Maybe (Item ArmourType)
    , _boots :: Maybe (Item ArmourType)
    , _inventory :: -- what goes here? [Item <something>]
    , _health :: Int
    , _characterClass :: Class
    }
```

- It cannot just be `Item`, since that has the wrong kind
- `Item (Armour|Weapon)Kind` works, but that defeats the polymorphic nature of the inventory
- I also tried something like `forall a. ItemType a => [Item a]`, but that also gives an error on the kind

Is GADTs a good approach here? I also considered type classes to mimic interfaces/abstract classes I would have used in an OOP approach to this problem. Feel free to invalidate my solution if you believe it best, but then you must come up with an alternative, and explain why it is better.

Can we make this work using GADTs?
